    <p>The internet has changed the way we access information, communicate and learn.
      There are thousands of websites that can teach you everything you'd want to learn about for free.
      There's no longer an excuse for not being able to learn something.
      I wanted to create a website that will point people towards the best places on the web to learn what they want.</p>

    <p>If you have any comments, questions, or websites that you think should be on here, email Xuan Li at <span class='red'>noexcuselist@gmail.com</span>.</p>

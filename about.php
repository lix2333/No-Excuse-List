    <p>The internet has changed the way we access information, communicate and learn.
      There are thousands of websites that can teach you everything you'd want to learn about for free. Unfortunately, it’s difficult and time consuming to find the best websites to use. In 2011, I decided to create a resource that connects students of all ages to free lessons from a curated list of web tutorials and courses. I have taken the time to research and try out almost every website on this list so that you don’t have to. There's no longer an excuse for not being able to learn something. Just click on a link and get started!</p>

I also follow the education technology and fashion retail start up scene closely in my free time. Those are pretty distinct industries for one person to track, but there have been so many exciting companies popping up I can’t help but follow their development. On the weekends, you can find me playing soccer or rooting for the Ohio State football team. </p>
